                1. Yes.
                2. Yes.
                3.1 Yes. The main audience is for my local MTG community. It's not at presentation level yet, but the overall project has come a long way.
                3.2 Yes. (in-between buttons/mana sprites/favicon I would say yes.)
                3.3 Yes.
                3.4 No. I eyeballed/juggled in my head what I wanted the layout to look like, not proffesional of me.(but i may still draw something up.)
                3.5 Yes. Originally, I had the "Calculate" button run the monte-carlo loop 1 million times, but it signifigantly slowed the page.
                3.6 I like how it looks.
                3.7 Yes.
                3.8 A lighthouse score of:
                4.1 Yes.
                4.2 Yes.(Quite a few)
                4.3 Yes.
                4.4
                    Objects: Yes.
                    Arrays: Yes.
                    forEach: Yes.
                    map: Yes.
                    reduce: Yes.
                    filter: Yes.</p>
