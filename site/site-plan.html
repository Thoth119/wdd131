            <h2>Ideas</h2>
            <p>So, currently my main idea is to make an AI using
                x.api on the backend. The plan is a chill LDS bot that helps with planning and is fun to chat with.
                If this idea currently doesn't aline with our stance on AI(as I have not fully read up on the talks/church opinion),
                I will happily consider my second idea, which is a MTG curve calculator. Currently,
                 the site I use has excellent calculations but is missing visualization and a more concrete breakdown of the
                 metrics. Either way, both of these projects are gonna take a lot of time, so please inform me ASAP what you think.
                Either way, this is gonna focus more on the back-end and less on aestetic. Which I know, the whole point of this class
            is based around presentation, I've always been more function over flavor though.</p>
